## Course Description
In this course, you will dive deep into advanced concepts and techniques necessary for building and evaluating state-of-the-art RAG applications. You'll start by learning methods like sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval to exceed the performance of baseline RAG pipelines. Then, you will focus on the evaluation best practices to ensure your RAG system is robust and delivers results that are relevant and trustworthy.

Key areas you will explore include:
- Enhancing retrieval techniques for better RAG performance.
- Streamlining the evaluation process with best practices.
- Understanding the RAG triad for evaluating:
  - Context Relevance
  - Groundedness
  - Answer Relevance
